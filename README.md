## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first time using SASS for a major project. I love how much more organized the stylesheet is, so much easier to find what I'm looking for. I learned that I really need to sit down and focus on the differences between mobile and desktop views before getting started. I definitely had to restructure parts of the design. This was my first time using different graphics based on screen size.

### Continued development

My solution for responsively switching out graphics could be more elegant
